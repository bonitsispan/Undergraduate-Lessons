## Project Descreption (Pathfinding in Grid Environments Using UCS and A* Algorithms)

This project implements intelligent pathfinding algorithms for robot navigation within randomly generated mazes. The robot must find the optimal path from a starting cell to the nearest of two goal cells, considering varying terrain costs. Implemented in Java, the system supports both Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A* search using a custom heuristic. It allows for performance comparison across different grid sizes and obstacle densities.
