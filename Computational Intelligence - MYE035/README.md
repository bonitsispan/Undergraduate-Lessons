# Project Descreption (Classification and Clustering with MLP and K-Means Algorithms)

This project involves the implementation of machine learning algorithms to solve classification and clustering problems on synthetic datasets. For the classification task, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network was developed with three hidden layers, supporting different activation functions (logistic, tanh, and ReLU). The network was trained using the gradient descent algorithm with mini-batch updates, and its performance was evaluated based on its generalization ability on a validation dataset. For the clustering task, the K-Means algorithm was implemented to partition datasets into different numbers of clusters (M = 3, 6, 9, 12). The program performs multiple runs with different random initializations and selects the clustering result with the lowest error. The project includes the creation of synthetic datasets for classification and clustering , evaluation of model performance under different configurations, and visualization of classification and clustering results.
