# Trajectory Design and Motion Control of a Pioneer P3-DX Robot Using ROS and Python

This project focuses on designing desired trajectories and implementing motion control for a simulated Pioneer P3-DX wheeled robot within a ROS-Gazebo environment. Using only velocity commands (`cmd_vel` topic), the robot was programmed to move through a sequence of desired positions and orientations, including intermediate and final targets. The motion planning was based on cubic polynomial trajectories for both translation and rotation, ensuring smooth movements within specified velocity constraints. The control logic was developed entirely in Python, leveraging ROS topics for reading odometry data (`/odom`) and publishing velocity commands (`/cmd_vel`). The system dynamically calculates the robotâ€™s position, orientation, and velocities during execution, ensuring real-time adjustments. The project emphasizes manual trajectory design without the use of pre-built ROS controllers, and includes structured phases such as initial rotation, translation, final orientation alignment, and trajectory validation through printed real-time data.
