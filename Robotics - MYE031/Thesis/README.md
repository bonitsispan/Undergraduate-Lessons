# Design and Implementation of a Force Controller for a Haptic Device used in Medical Applications

This diploma thesis focuses on the design, modeling, and implementation of a force controller for a haptic device intended for use in medical applications. The project involved the complete construction of a haptic mechanism, along with the analysis of its Forward Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics, and dynamic behavior. A mathematical model of the system was developed based on a mass-spring physical model to accurately simulate and predict the force responses.The control system was designed and implemented to regulate forces exerted by the haptic device, ensuring precise and responsive feedback for user interactions. Python was used to program and integrate the force controller with the hardware setup. This work aims to contribute toward more accurate and reliable haptic interfaces for medical training and rehabilitation applications, where realistic force feedback is critical.
