# Project Description (Handwritten Digits Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques)

This project focuses on the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using various machine learning and deep learning methods. Initially, traditional machine learning models were implemented, including Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). A custom k-NN classifier was developed from scratch, utilizing Euclidean distance and majority voting for label prediction. To address the high dimensionality of the dataset and enhance the efficiency of the models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as a dimensionality reduction technique, subsequently integrated with the k-NN algorithm. Additionally, a deep neural network (DNN) was built and trained using PyTorch to achieve higher classification accuracy. The performance of all models was evaluated through confusion matrices and standard accuracy metrics. This project highlights essential skills in machine learning, dimensionality reduction, algorithm development, and deep learning frameworks.
